# EMSv2: Expression Modifier Score v2

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook and codebase for the EMSv2 (Expression Modifier Score v2) model, a machine learning model designed for prioritizing regulatory variants in the human genome. EMSv2 leverages long-range DNA sequence features and a multi-task learning framework to improve prediction accuracy across various tissues and populations, as described in our study.

## Getting Started with Colab

Open the EMSv2_notebook.ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
