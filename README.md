# EMSv2: Expression Modifier Score v2

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook for EMSv2 (Expression Modifier Score v2), a machine learning model designed to prioritize regulatory variants in the human genome. EMSv2 leverages long-range DNA sequence features and a multi-task learning framework to improve prediction accuracy across various tissues and populations.

## Usage
Examples of EMSv2 calculations can be found in `ems_usage.ipynb`.
